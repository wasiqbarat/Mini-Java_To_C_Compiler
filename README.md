# Mini-Java to C Compiler

This project is a compiler that translates Mini-Java code into C code, including the generation of Three-Address Code (TAC). This project is part of the Compiler Design course and is intended to provide a hands-on understanding of the key components of a compiler.

## About the Project

The compiler is divided into four main parts:

* **Lexer (Lexical Analysis):** The lexer breaks down the source Mini-Java code into a stream of tokens.
* **Parser (Syntax Analysis):** The parser takes the tokens from the lexer and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
* **Semantic Analyzer:** The semantic analyzer checks the source code for semantic errors, such as type mismatches and undeclared variables.
* **Code Generator:** The code generator translates the AST into an intermediate representation (Three-Address Code) and then into C code.

## Features

* **Lexical Analysis:** The lexer can recognize and tokenize Mini-Java code, including keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals.
* **Syntax Analysis:** The parser can build an AST from a stream of tokens, ensuring that the code is syntactically correct.
* **Semantic Analysis:** The semantic analyzer can detect and report semantic errors in the source code.
* **Code Generation:** The code generator can produce Three-Address Code and C code from an AST.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a working knowledge of Java and C. You will also need to be familiar with the concepts of lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Phases

The project is divided into the following phases:

1.  **Lexical Analysis:** In this phase, you will implement the lexer for the Mini-Java language.
2.  **Syntax Analysis:** In this phase, you will implement the parser for the Mini-Java language.
3.  **Semantic Analysis:** In this phase, you will implement the semantic analyzer for the Mini-Java language.
4.  **Code Generation:** In this phase, you will implement the code generator for the Mini-Java language.
